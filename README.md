ðŸ“Œ Script Overview

This Bash script configures a Raspberry Pi as:
âœ… A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) on wlan0, allowing devices to connect
âœ… A WireGuard VPN client, routing all traffic through a VPS
âœ… A NAT gateway, forwarding traffic from the AP through the VPN

This setup allows you to connect a laptop (or other devices) to the Raspberry Pi and have all traffic tunneled through WireGuard.
